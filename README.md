# Picktopia Pickleball Club - Landing Page

This repository contains the code for the temporary landing page for the Picktopia Pickleball Club.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this landing page is to promote the club and provide basic information to interested individuals while the official website is under development. It serves as an initial online presence for the club.

## Tech Stack

This project is built using:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server.

## Development

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd picktopia_website
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start the development server, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Status

This landing page is a temporary solution. The official Picktopia Pickleball Club website is currently in development and will replace this page upon completion.
